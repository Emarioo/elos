# How the OS is designed
The OS has:
- Bootloader : Performs setup based on the processor it runs on and starts the kernel.
- Kernel : Manager of the system resources.
- Application : The user programs which requests resources from the Kernel.



For fun, wouldn't it be cool to run PE and ELF applications, Linux and Windows?
Like steam's proton builtin to the kernel?
