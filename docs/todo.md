# Goals
- [x] Load second bootloader with more than 512 bytes.
- [ ] Compiler and load kernel in C.
- [ ] Call assembly functions from C code.
- [ ] FAT12 file system.
- [ ] Terminal user interface.
- [ ] Terminal text editor.

## Loading kernel
I have C code
I have assembly code
I want to compile it and put into a floppy image.
Then read disc sectors and load it into memory.

Compiling C code into a binary blob is harder than it should be.
