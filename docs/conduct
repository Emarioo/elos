
# Rules for project
- NO bash or batch scripts. How you interract with the project on Windows is the same as on Linux. Use python for scripts.
- NO Makefiles. Use python. Makefiles don't consistently work on both Linux and Windows.
- NO MSVC because project should work on Linux and Windows.
- All intermediate files are placed in `bin` (object files, binaries)
- Write tests. Any test is fine, just write them, at least one when implementing something and integrate it with all tests so you can test them all and know if something broke which worked before.

# Rules when writing code
- You shall document all assembly
- You shall write documentation for all code.
- DO NOT write prototypes or experimental code and leave it as good enough. Finish each component thoroughly before moving on. (implmenting a full feature is not required but do not leave code half done)
- Complex code (file system, multiprocess management) shall be documented in techincal detail. (shell parsing is just needs a guide on synstax, technincal details not so important)
