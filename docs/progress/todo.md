Categories are standardized in singular and lower case.

The top sections are:
- **Kernel/OS**
- **User environment and applications**

- @current What is currently worked on or planned to be worked on. (may change a lot)
- @urgent Something is broken for 90% of theoretical users
- @feature Literally a new feature, new program, new file system, support for drives, network or whatever
- @optimize Improve software performance
- @bug Large list of known problems, not critical, just annoying
- @experiment Do for fun
- @project Related to project,  not so much code or kernel. Can be things like better README, clairfy dependencies, improve build guide.

# Kernel/OS
Tasks related to kernel and operating system

## @current
- [ ] Support multiple mice and keyboards (might be a while but this would be cool and i'm excited for the implementation)

## @urgent

## @bug

## @feature
- [ ] Kernel logger. Logs actions in the OS. Files open, written to. Apps started stopped.

## @project
- [ ] Clearly state dependencies of this project. Do fresh Ubuntu install in VirtualBox and compile this project, see what you need.
- [ ] A way to compile the project on Windows? Are there tools for it or is Linux the only?

## @optimize

## @experiment

# User environment and applications

## @feature
- [ ] Provide C compiler in OS by default. (TinyCC? how do we compile it?)
- [ ] Provide Git by default. (build from source using TinyCC?)
